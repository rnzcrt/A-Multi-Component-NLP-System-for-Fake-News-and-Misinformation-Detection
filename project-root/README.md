## Project Overview
This system is an NLP-based misinformation detection pipeline combining:
- **Core Model:** Fine-tuned DistilBERT for veracity classification
- **CNN Component:** Text-CNN (Kim, 2014) as baseline and ablation
- **NLP Component:** NER-based provenance tagging (spaCy)
- **RL Component:** Contextual bandit for adaptive threshold tuning

## Dataset
[LIAR Dataset](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip) — 12,836 labeled political statements from PolitiFact.

## Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Setup environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Download data
python data/get_data.py

# 3. Run full pipeline (train + eval, ~60 min on Colab T4)
bash run.sh
```

## Results (to be updated)
| Model | Macro-F1 | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Majority baseline | - | - |
| Text-CNN | - | - |
| DistilBERT (fine-tuned) | - | - |
